# Databases-Course-Project

This project was created by Matthew Lad, Jennifer Stone, and Caleb Covert at Samford University as the final project for a Databases Course.

It is the database used for a fictional company run by the three authors above. The company is called the NQL or National Quidditch League and as the name implies is a sports league based company.

The database was created using Azure data studio on an azure lab virtual machine. The files included are for our create statements and select statements. Also included are various diagrams and powerpoint used in the project.
